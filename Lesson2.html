<!--If I were to give you a penny today and double your money every day for a year, how much money would you have? Please show the code.

Hint: use a for loop that has the following structure, but change the values:

//this will loop 31 times:

for (var i = 1;i < 31; i++){

    }
-->

<body>
    <script>
        // define the penny total 
        var penny = 0.01;

        for (var i = 1; i < 365; i++){ // the user can use i = 0; i < 364; and the total would be  $3.757668132438133e+107
            penny = penny*2;
            console.log('$' + penny  + '');
           

}
    // log the total 
    document.write('If you doubled a Penny everyday for 365 days, you would have $' + penny + ' saved!');
